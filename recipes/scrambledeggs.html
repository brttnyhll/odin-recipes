        <h2>Description</h2>
        <P>Eggs that are scrambled. You crack them then scramble them up. Make
            sure to cook them in a pan. No soggy eggs here. 
        </p>
        <p>If you get the eggs to room temperture first they won't stick to
            the pan. Isn't that neat. 
        </p>
