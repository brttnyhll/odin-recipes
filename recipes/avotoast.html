        <h2>Toast with some avocado on it</h2>
        <p>Really in depth analysis about avocado toast and why it's good.
            Very simple and tasty. My dead grandma made avocado toast in 1920
            for my grandpa. It's not just millenials.
        </p>
        <p>You can't afford a house if you have too much avocado toast. Avocados
            are very expensive. Especially at Whole Foods. Like double the price
            of anywhere else.
